# TODO

(could be inspired from: [GPU backend testing](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete/tree/main/backends/concrete-cuda/implementation/test_and_benchmark/test))
- reference file to explain how to test a backend
- should be useful for someone who contribute to an existing backend and want to test its modifications
